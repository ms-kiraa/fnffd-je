THIS NEEDS JAVA 21!!!!!!!
to run, open cmd IN THIS DIRECTORY and type "path/to/java/21/bin/folder/java.exe -jar fnffd-je.jar"

you will probably see errors along the lines of "COULD NOT FIND OBJECT TO DRAW WITH DRAW ID (number)" but it doesnt matter,
as long as the game still runs and works its fine

default binds are dfjk, cant change these yet srry just deal

to change the song go into SONG_TO_LOAD_NAME.txt and change it to any file name in the charts folder WITHOUT THE SWOWS!!!
the current thing in there (twinkle) is a good example of what to do with it

yeah you can probably put in your own  songs and charts, heres a guide on how to do it
drop a .swows file into the charts folder named the same thing as the song
drop the song IN WAV FORMAT (VERY VERY IMPORTANT!!!) into the songs folder
ignore the .swews files they're useless as of rn
